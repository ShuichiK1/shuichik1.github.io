        <h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Shuichi Kameda and I am currently a second-year student at the University of Rhode Island. My major is Computer Engineering and I hope to establish a career in computer hardware development.
        <br>I enjoy exploring the wilderness, be it through camping or biking. I also appreciate the art of creating music.
        <br>Later in life, I would like to go on an expedition to Antarctica. It might sound crazy, but it is something that has been in my bucket list for a while.
